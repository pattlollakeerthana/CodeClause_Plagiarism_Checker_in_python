Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.
Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast.
Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. 
Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for 
Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 
Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
